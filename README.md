### Exercise 1: `length()` - Finding the  String's Size

**Code Snippet**
![Screenshot Proof](/e1-cs.png?raw=true "exercise-1-code-snippet")

**Prediction**: _This code will output 14 as there are 14 characters in the string "Hello, Cadets!" (including whitespace and symbols)._ 

**Output**

**Prediction**: _This code will output the character 'l'._

**Output**
