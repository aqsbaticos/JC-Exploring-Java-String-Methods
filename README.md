### Exercise 1: `length()` - Finding the  String's Size

**Code Snippet**

![Screenshot Proof](/ss/e1-cs.png?raw=true "exercise-1-code-snippet")

**Prediction**: _This code will output 14 as there are 14 characters in the string "Hello, Cadets!" (including whitespace and symbols)._ 

**Output**

**Observation**: _As expected, the value returned by the length() method was 14._

---
### Exercise 2: `charAt()` - Accessing a Character

**Code Snippet**

![Screenshot Proof](/ss/e2-cs.png?raw=true "exercise-2-code-snippet")

**Prediction**: _This code will output the character 'l'._

**Output**

![Screenshot Proof](/ss/e2-o.png?raw=true "exercise-2-output")

**Observation**: _As expected, the value returned by the charAt() method was 'l'._

---
### Exercise 3: `substring()` - Extracting a Part of a String

**Code Snippet**

![Screenshot Proof](/ss/e3-cs.png?raw=true "exercise-3-code-snippet")

**Prediction**: _This code will output the string 'is ' (including the whitespace)._

**Output**

![Screenshot Proof](/ss/e3-o.png?raw=true "exercise-3-output")

**Observation**: _The value returned by the substring() method was 'is' only._

---
### Exercise 4: `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()` - Changing Case

**Code Snippet**

![Screenshot Proof](/ss/e4-cs.png?raw=true "exercise-4-code-snippet")

**Prediction**: _This code will output the strings "THIS IS A TEST" and "this is a test" respectively._

**Output**

![Screenshot Proof](/ss/e4-o.png?raw=true "exercise-4-output")

**Observation**: _As expected, the value returned by the toUpperCase() and toLowerCase() methods were "THIS IS A TEST" and "this is a test" respectively._
